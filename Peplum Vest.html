<img class="homeimages" src="Peplum Vest.jpg" height="400" width="400" alt="Peplum Vest">
<br>
<div class="crochet">This pattern is worked top-down in one piece. If you know how to make raglan sleeve pattern already then it is super<br>
duper easy for you! Otherwise also it is an easy pattern and uses simple stitches!<br><br>

This vest is made thick and warm like a coat. Dress up with a long sleeve top or thermal and a pair of leggings and cute<br>
little boots!<br><br>

All crochet terms are US terms. If you would like to buy a printable pdf you can buy it in my Etsy Store.<br><br>

<br>
<div class="quilling">
<b>Row1:</b> hhdc in third ch from hook and all remaining stitches. 42<br><br>

<b>Row2:</b> with stitch markers mark the 8th, 13th, 29th, 34th stitch. Ch2 turn, hhdc in each stitch except the ones with stitch<br>
markers. We are going to do 3 hhdc in each stitch(referred to as 3 stitch cluster here on) with a stitch marker. 50<br><br>

<b>Row3:</b> ch2 turn, work 1 hhdc in each stitch across except the middle stitch from the 3 stitch clusters of the previous row.<br>
We are going to work 3 hhdc in each of the middle stitches. 58<br><br>

<b>Here on every row will increase by 8 stitches.</b><br>
For size 2T:  repeat Row3, seven times.<br>
For size 3T: repeat Row3, eight times.<br>
For size 4T; repeat row 3, nine times.<br><br>

<b>Making the armholes:</b>

<b>Row1:</b> ch2 turn, work 1 hhdc in each stitch until you reach the middle stitch of first 3 stitch cluster. Work 1 hhdc in the<br>
middle stitch, ch 4, work 1 hhdc in the middle stitch of the next 3 cluster stitch. We are skipping all the remaining stitches<br>
between the 3 cluster stitches. Work 1 hhdc until you reach the middle stitch of the next 3 cluster stitch. Work 1 hhdc into<br>
the middle stitch, ch 4 work 1 hhdc into the middle stitch of the next cluster. Work 1 hhdc until you reach the end of the row.<br><br>

Now your work should start looking like a vest.

<b>Bodice:</b><br><br>

<b>Row1:</b> ch2 turn, work 1 hhdc into each stitch across.<br><br>

<b>For size 2T:</b> Repeat Row1 of bodice fifteen times.<br>
<b>For size 3T:</b> Repeat Row1 of bodice sixteen times.<br>
<b>For size 4T:</b> Repeat Row1 of bodice seventeen times.<br><br>

<b>Belt R1:</b> ch1 turn, sc across.<br><br>

<b>Skirt:</b><br><br>

<b>Row1:</b> ch 2 turn, 2 hhdc in ach stitch across.<br>
<b>Row2-5:</b> ch 2 turn, work 1 hhdc in each stitch across.<br><br>

<b>Edging:</b><br><br>

With CC we will crochet hdc stitches along the bottom, go up the front of one side, around the neck and come down the<br>
other side and join back to where we started.<br><br>

Change to CC. Ch2 turn, work 1 hdc across, working a total of 3 stitches in the last stitch of the row. Rotate your work and<br>
even work hdc stitches along the front of one side of the vest. Work 3 hdc in the corner stitch and 1 hdc along each stitch<br>
of the neck, which is the foundation ch row. Work 3 hdc in the other corner of the neck, and rotate to work hdc stitches<br>
along the other front side of the vest. Work 2 stitches in the first stitch of CC, join with a ss and fasten off.<br><br>

<b>Armhole edging: </b><br>
Join CC in the middle of the armhole, facing right side of the vest, work 1 hdc stitch around, join with a ss and fasten off.<br>
Repeat for other armhole.<br><br>

Attach buttons, use the hdc edging as button holes 😊<br><br>

Add a simple flower of you like or leave it plain 😊<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> I did start with sleeves initially but decided to keep it a vest. If you want to add sleeves attach your arm in the<br>
middle of the under arm and work a hhdc in stitch around decreasing 2 stitches in the first 2 rows. Always join and turn<br>
your rows to have the same texture as the bodice. Also, when you join the arm in the underarm be mindful of the <br>
direction. You will notice it immediately after a few stitches if the direction is not right.<br><br>
