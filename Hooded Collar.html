<div class="crochet">HOODED COLLAR FREE CROCHET<BR>PATTERN</div>
<img class="homeimages" src="collar1.jpg" height="400" width="400" alt="Peplum Vest">
<br>
<div class="crochet">Sometimes our kids have that favorite jacket that does not have a hood and that is the only jacket they will wear. How i<br>
wished there was a way to add a hood to those! So here is something i designed for my son. It is warm and fuzzy and i <br>
even plan to layer it with fleece for the frigid weather.<br><br>

Best of all he loves it! I asked him whether he would like a button on front or just a round turtle neck to pull it over his<br>
head and he said he wanted the button. So be it :)<br><br>
<img class="homeimages" src="collar2.jpg" height="400" width="400" alt="Peplum Vest"><br><br>
<div class="quilling">
<b>Construction:</b>
The general construction of the hooded collar is to create a horizontal panel wide enough to go around the neck. Then<br>
create a vertical panel for the hood. This peice needs to wrap around the head.<br><br>
</div>
<div class="quilling">
<b>Materials:</b>
<b>Yarn:</b> Chunky weight 5 yarn, I used Bernat softee baby chunky in white and Bernat softee chunky in Faded Denim<br>
<b>Hook:</b> 7.00 mm hook<br>
Tapestry needle<br>
Wooden buttons<br><br>

<b>Abbreviations:</b><br>
<b>sc:</b> single crochet<br>
<b>sl:</b> slip stitch<br>
<b>hdc:</b> half double crochet<br>
<b>YOSS:</b> Yarn over slip stitch.<br>
<b>MC:</b> Main color<br>
<b>CC:</b> Contrast Color<br>
<b>BLO:</b> Back loops only<br>
<b>FPDC:</b> Front post double crochet<br>
<b>BPDC:</b> Back post double crochet<br><br>

<b>Special Stitch</b>
<b>YOSS:</b> Yarn over, 2 loops on hook, insert hook in next stitch and pull up a loop and pull it through the 2 previous loops on<br>
hook.<br><br>

Below numbers are for size 4-6 years. You can easily adjust to any size. Make your foundation chain long enough to<br>
around the neck at the bottom of the shoulders, forming a V shape at the bottom and add 6-7 chains more to it. Just like a <br>
collar would sit and allow for some overlap to add a button.<br><br>

<b>Collar</b><br>
Chain 54 with MC<br>
<b>Row1:</b> YOSS in second chain from hook and all the way across (53).<br>
<b>Row2:</b> ch1 turn YOSS in BLO across the row<br>
<b>Row3-10:</b> Repeat Row 2until you have reached a desired width(53)<br><br>

<b>Row11:</b> ch1 turn sc 10, chain 31 or as many ch needed to reach the height from shoulder to crown.<br>
Do not fasten off.<br><br>

<b>Hood </b><br><br>

ch 31 from Row11 of collar works as the foundation chain for the hood.<br>
<b>Row1:</b> work 1 hdc in 2nd ch from hook and in remaining 29 ch, then ss to base of collar (30).<br>
<b>Row2:</b> ss in next stitch of collar, ch1 turn, sc across in 3rd loop of hdc from previous row of hood (30).<br>

<b>Note:</b> do not fasten off if you know how to carry yarn through rows. Otherwise, fasten off. We will be changing colors <br>
every 2 rows for the rest of the hood and end in MC.<br><br>

<b>Row3:</b> change to CC, ch1 turn hdc in BLO across, ss to base of hood (30).<br>
<b>Row4:</b> ss to next stitch of collar, ch1 turn sc in 3rd loop of hdc from previous row (30).<br>
<b>Row5:</b> change to MC, ch1 turn hdc in BLO across, ss to base of hood (30).<br>
<b>Row6:</b> ss to next stitch of collar, ch1 turn sc in 3rd loop of hdc from previous row (30).<br><br>

Repeat rows 3-6 seven more times or until 11 stitches remain on collar.<br><br>

<b>Row 35:</b> ch1 turn, sc across and ss to collar, ch1 and sc in next 10 stitches of collar.<br>
Optional Row36: I did a ch1 turn and a round of hdc all the way around. working 3 hdc in corners and hdc2t on the<br>
stitches where hood meets the collar.<br><br>

At this point the hood part should wrap around the head from centre of one ear to another. We are going to gain some<br>
more width from the ribbing.<br><br>

Fold the piece in half along the red line and sew along the blue line using either ss or sc.<br><br>

<b>Ribbing</b>
Attach white (CC) with sl on either side of the collar, one stitch away from where hood and collar meet.<br>
Ribbing Row1: dc in each stitch along the rim of the hood, join back to collar with ss skipping one stitch from the hood<br><br>

<b>Ribbing Row2:</b> ss to next stitch on collar, FPDC in first stich of hood from previous round, BPDC in next stitch, FPDC in next <br>
and so on, alternate between FPDC and BPDC across the rim and join with a ss in the hood.<br><br>

<b>Ribbing Row3:</b> repeat ribbing row 2.<br><br>

Fasten off and add a button on the collar as shown in the picture. No need for a button hole as we can use the hdc row<br>
for that.<br><br>
<div class="crochet">I ended up adding 2 buttons to make the fit snug.<br>
That's my boy on our trip to the craft store!☺️</div>
